title: Blogging with Jekyll
---

I've used tons of hosted blogging platforms in the past, but I'm trying something a bit different this time, called Jekyll. Jekyll is 
a static site generator. The idea is that you create your site templates, then create your content in text files using something like 
Markdown or textile, and then run a script which puts everything together. No database or dynamic server language like php or ruby is 
needed. The resulting site is just old fashioned static html. It is a simple system that can considerably reduce the load on a server. 
I also allows a lot more flexibility. A fairly common way to use a static site generator is to run it on your local machine, and sync 
the contents to a source repository, and push just the html output to your webhost.

So, I'll see how this goes. I like working in Markdown (although there are other ways to do that) and I like the ability to just zip 
up a site to back things up.
