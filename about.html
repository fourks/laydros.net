<h3>Interests</h3>
<b>Art</b>
<p>I love music and I've always been interested in visual and performance art.
I played in a band in college and constantly feed on new music. I don't play
much music now, but recently I have been very interested in photography and writing.</p>
<b>Technology</b>
<p>I have always been a technology "enthusiast" and most of my jobs have been
related to technology. I love hardware and gadgets, but most of my focus now is
on development. I am very interested in open source, web 2.0, and mobile technology.
I also think technology can be a tool that opens up opportunities for people. 
It may be as simple as letting a talented musician get their material out, or 
as critical as providing major economic opportunities who would otherwise be 
cut off from the rest of the world for location, economic, or other reasons.</p>
