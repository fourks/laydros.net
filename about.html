<h3>Interests</h3>
<b>Art</b>  
<p>My first love is music. I have listened to rock music since I was 
old enough to operate the clock radio in my room. Along the way I played guitar, 
and spent time in my high school jazz band and a local rock band in my early 
college years. As I've gotten older I have started branching out to jazz, 
hip-hop, indie rock/pop, and even some classical and world music.</p>
<p>I have always enjoyed visual and performing arts. I still love enjoying others
work and have dabbled in painting and drawing. The two areas I spend the most time in 
now are writing and photography. I am currently a staff writer for a Macintosh
focused blog, macgasm.net. In the past I was involved in bloggina and podcasting
for a general tech site called Tipmonkies, and I have had several personal blogs. 
Around the time my younger daughter, Eleanor, was born in 2008 I finally 
jumped on my interest in photography, which started when I saw the work being 
done in the photography classes at my high school. Photography seemed to be a 
great mix of my interests in art and technology. I have shot a few weddings, 
done some family and kids work for friends, and did the album photos for a local
band.</p>
<b>Technology</b>
<p>I can't really say at what point my interest in technology started. I know
when I was a kid I tried to talk my parents into buying a computer for me, but
it never happened. However I was always taking things apart to learn how they
worked, and loved math and science classes at school. I loved gadgets. I was
always trying to get a new stereo or Game Boy or Walkman. In high school I
landed a job as a technology associate at Office Max, and within 6 months I was
the department supervisor. I had an appitite to learn more, that was never 
totally satisfied. I had a late start as a computer geek, but I made up for it
by reading every book or magazine I could get my hands on, and asking so many
questions of the few "mentors" I had that they got sick of it.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the line I heard about GNU/Linux. My interest in learning 
more about this "other" operating system was certainly the catalyst that took me 
from someone with an interest in technology to someone who would spend the next
half of my life in technology focused jobs. I didn't have access to a high speed
connection, or any spare computers, but managed to get my 486 laptop with a 500mb
harddrive triple booting Windows 98, NT4, and any one of a slew of Linux distros.
I fought with floppy based distros to get X windows working. Once I had that 
going I spent days trying to get my dial up modem working. Eventually, with enough
library books, internet searches at 36k, and late nights of trial and error, I
learned my way around computer hardware, networking, and operating systems. I 
took a couple of unix classes that didn't count towards my degree out of pure
interest while I was attending a community college. In the first classe I was 
amazed to learn about the power of the shell. I could make all these commands
talk to each other. I could loop over a directory, send the output to a filter,
and then send that filtered output straight to the printer as if it was a file.
I was enjoying learning about the commands of the vi editor so much that I
didn't pay much attention to the next section, on emacs. My proudest moment was
in the last unix class I took, when my instructor, who's background was in the 
Novell world and didn't really know unix, had to sit down at the back of the
class to have me help her fix part of her lesson that wasn't working.</p>
<p>My younger brother loved (and loves) video games, and took up programming
while in high school. I would look at Microsoft Word or Diablo II, and then 
think about what must happen to make those work, and decided programming would
be far too tedious for me. I loved music but didn't have any desire to tune harps,
so why would my interest in technology be enough to make me want to do write code?
Then my boss at Intrex offered me a project. Intrex wasn't great at moving people
up, so I jumped at the chance. I knew my way around HTML, and he wanted a more
robust interface for our co-location customers to access thier statistics. I
somehow landed on using Perl for the project, and bought the OReilly Learning
Perl book. I quickly figured out how to get a few things done, and realized a
few things along the way. One was that I should have gone ahead and bought 
"Programming Perl" because Larry Wall is a very funny guy, and also that 
programming wasn't really much more complicated than the if statements, loops, 
and variables I learned from writing bash scripts and the occasional Dos batch
script. Perhaps most importantly, I was making something. Not only was coding
not as tedious as I had originally worried, but it filled the same creative itch
that had previously led me to write/play music or paint.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2007 I was married, had a house, and had been working at FedEx 
Kinko's for a while. I was entering my last semester of college, now at NC State 
University. I started college in the fall of 2001, but didn't take more than 
12 hours many semesters, and even had a few that I took less. Almost a semester 
worth of unix classes I took with no credit towards graduation didn't help either. 
A friend of mine that worked at IBM told me about an internship in his group. I
jumped at the chance, although I didn't think I had a great chance. However, 
largely due to some help from my friend, I got it. I was managing the testing
and development lab for the Datapower XML appliance development team. I knew unix
and hardware, so I was able to keep machines running, updated, passing company
security audits, and install software or configure testing scenarios. In return
I learned more than I could have imagined. In almost every prior job and in school
I always felt like a big fish in a little pond when it came to skills. But in
this environment I was just a kid that couldn't code his way out of a wet paper
bag. IBM is filled with smart people, and these were the best of the best. My 
indirect/de facto second line manager was the CTO of WebSphere, and one of it's
founders. Half the people on my team had a Ph.D, and the other half only didn't
because they had such a mind blowing resume it wouldn't help. And to top it all
off, all of them were super nice, and always willing to help.</p>
<p>On the Friday of my first week, I went to my first all hands meeting (second
line manager down), we took a visiting developer out for lunch, and a few of my
new IBM coworkers came out to the Friday night dinner and drinks. After just 
this first week of my first "real" job, and my first serious technical job,
I knew I wanted to be in this field. I stayed late talking to the friend that 
helped me get the position, and my new mentor. They told me look into adding on
a computer science minor. After six and a half years of college I loathed the 
idea of staying longer, but this seemed worth it.</p>
<p>NC State, like most other schools, has started to focus on Java development.
A look at the professional programming job postings on monster.com will lead 
one to think this is a good idea. However, based on the advice of my new found
advisors from IBM, I did my minor in C++. I didn't learn much about GUI development
or working with APIs when I was in school, but I did learn a lot more about what
really happens on the lower levels. I had to give my objects distructors, and
build things out of pointers. Luckily my father in law is not only a long time
software developer, but was a hobbiest in the days when you couldn't operate a
computer without knowing your way around the CPUs registers and memory 
addressing. A kind and patient man, he would stay at my house late at night to
help me get a real grasp on some of the concepts. I'm convinced that most of my
peers didn't get the same level of education/dollar that I did in my CS minor, 
largely because of the extra questions I asked my father in law or coworkers
along the way.</p>
<p>My computer science education was an immersion. I took about 2 classes per
semester for 4 straight semesters (including a summer). During this time I was
working full time at IBM during the day. I would a new concept, and then ask
my father in law or coworkers about it. Sometimes I would learn technical 
details, sometimes I would learn about the cutting edge applications of the 
concept, and sometimes I would learn about the history. My assembler class was
especially fun to talk to my father in law about, because he now works in a very
modern, high level environment, but had spent plenty of time figuring out just
how to jam enough stuff in the registers of a Z80 to get by. My assembler
projects were in part graded on number of lines of code, and that was just the
right kind of puzzle to get myself and my mentors engaged.</p>
<p>My urge to soak up new stuff like a sponge never went away. I want to solve
more problems. I want to use the best ways possible to solve them. I want my
code to not just work, but be maintainable, efficient, and when possible,
creative. When there is a new technology out there that allows me to improve
on these things, I'll jump all over it. I love the move of software to the web.
If we keep things standards complient, we can write something well one time, and
it will work on any computer or smartphone. People are building loosely coupled
tools with good APIs that can be strung together like the unix command line. 
Without getting too hippie about things, our new abilitys to collaborate and
crowdsource make things possible that we only dreamed of just ten years ago.
The conversations and ideas are still the important part, but the technology
behind Wikipedia, Twitter, Craigslist, Facebook, and GMail are allowing these
conversations to happen in ways they never have before.</p>
<p>When the Tiananmen Square protests happened in 1989, people in the west with
strong ideas about human rights and freedom paid attention. But when the Iranian
elections of 2009 were protested, we could read tweets from individuals in the
streets. We could directly interact with individual people on the other side of
the planet on a minute by minute basis, with almost no financial cost. When 
Egypt shut down communications during the protests in 2011, people around the
world rallied to make sure as many people as possible could still have a voice.
The people of Egypt, poor farmers and rich business owners, men and women, all
had a voice they didn't have just 10 years ago. They were finally able to push
out a dictator who had abused a state of emergency for 30 years to control them.
</p>
<p>When I post to the Macro Monday pool on flickr, I can have feedback within a day 
from people all over the world. I can see what is an interesting photography 
subject to a lady just barely getting by in San Francisco, using an
internet cafe to post pictures from the 6 year old digital camera her sister let
her borrow, or an architect in Paris, or a 9 year old that lives right here in
Raleigh, who without the internet wouldn't have the means or respect to have
her work shown to other photographers.</p>
